# Cucumber-Java-Selenium

This is a simple setup for Cucumber with Selenium using Java.

## Project Requirements / Recommendations

- GitHub Account
- IDE - IntelliJ IDEA
- Defaults to run using Google Chrome, please ensure this is installed
- Maven
- Java 21

## Setup Instructions

Open a command/terminal window at the same level as this readme and run:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Run the tests

The runner is available [here](src/test/java/io/cucumber/RunCucumberTest.java)

A basic HTML report will be available [here](target/cucumber-report/cucumber.html) after a test run.

### Running Tests by Tags

You can run specific tests by filtering with Cucumber tags.

Run tests with a single tag:

```sh
mvn clean test "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@login"
```

Run tests with multiple tags (using OR condition):

```sh
mvn clean test "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@regression or @login"
```

Run tests with multiple tags (using AND condition):

```sh
mvn clean test "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@regression and @smoke"
```

## Feature Files

The feature files live [here](src/test/resources/io/cucumber/features/theInternet.feature)

## Required Task

```
Please clone this repo (do NOT fork it), and follow good version control practices.

- An initial commit after cloning the repo, before making any changes.
- Any additional commits you want as you progress through the task.
```

There are 3 titled scenarios in the [feature file](src/test/resources/io/cucumber/features/theInternet.feature).

Please complete the scenarios to cover the requirements. Feel free to rework/create step definitions, rework/create Page Object Models as you deem appropriate.

Once you have completed the task, please push your work to your own GitHub repo and share the link to the project with us for review prior to the interview. Please expect some questions/technical discussion during the interview, relating to your implementation of the given task.
